## Design
- Hierarchy: A big picture of me so the viewer can put a face to the owner of the website

- Grouping: 

- Similarity: I will have a theme with similar colors so the website is visually appealing



 ## Accessibility
- Alternatives for Images: Provide descriptive alt text for images, allowing users with visual impairments to understand the content of images through screen readers

- Keyboard Navigation: Ensure that all interactive elements, such as links and forms, are navigable using a keyboard alone, as some users may have difficulty using a mouse

- Contrast and Color: Use sufficient color contrast between text and background to make content readable for users with low vision or color blindness

- Video and Audio: Provide captions and transcripts for videos and audio content to make them accessible to users who are deaf or hard of hearing
